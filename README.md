## Installation

To initialize the database, create a new database in your local/localhost route called "saga_movies_weekend". Inside of that database, using Postico or another SQL app, run the SQL queries provided in database.sql to get the initial table up and running with some test data.

Download the repository and [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). With the folder open in your terminal, run 'npm install' inside the terminal window. Run 'npm run server' in the terminal, open a new terminal and run 'npm run client'. You will be able to view the app at localhost:3000.

## Usage

- Main page is the gallery of movies stored in the database.
- Clicking on a movie poster takes the user to a page where they can view the details about that particular movie.
- Clicking "submit a movie" in the header takes the user to a page to submit a new movie to the database.
- There is a preview section on the submit a movie page, ensuring that the picture the user is uploading will look good!
